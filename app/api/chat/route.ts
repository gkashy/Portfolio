Personal Journey
Gaurav's journey is marked by resilience and determination. After graduating from high school in Dubai with an IB Diploma, he faced a setback when his admission to UBC was revoked due to math scores not matching predicted grades. With universities' admissions closed, he attended community college, where he mastered mathematics and eventually tutored others.
He successfully transferred to Simon Fraser University's Mechatronic Systems Engineering program in 2019. During his third year, he faced serious health issues that forced him to take a year off. This confrontation with mortality transformed his mindset, and he returned to university with renewed determination, achieving perfect grades and developing new skills.
This experience shaped his fearless approach to challenges. He was admitted to the University of Toronto's Master's program, where he maintains a perfect 4.0 GPA while balancing multiple ambitious projects. His personal mantra reflects his outlook: "I'm here to win. Nothing stops me. Nothing scares me. I can do anything I set my mind toâ€”that is my superpower."
